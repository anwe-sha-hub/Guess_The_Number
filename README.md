# 🔢 Guess the Number Game (C Language)

A fun and interactive Guess the Number game built using C.
The program randomly selects a number between 1 and 100, and the user must guess it in as few attempts as possible!

---
## 🎮 How It Works
The program generates a random number using rand() seeded with the current time.

You enter your guesses.

The program gives you hints:

"Enter lower number please" if your guess is too high

"Enter higher number please" if your guess is too low

It tracks the number of attempts and shows it when you guess correctly.
